             *  - Inactive:  The subscription is past the expiration date, and the user turned off the automatic renew option for the subscription.
             *  - Canceled:  The subscription has been purposefully terminated before the expiration date, with or without a refund.
             *  - InDunning:  The subscription is in dunning (that is, the subscription is nearing expiration, and Microsoft is trying to acquire funds to automatically renew the subscription).
             *  - Failed:  The dunning period is over and the subscription failed to renew after several attempts.

             *
             *  - Inactive/Canceled/Failed are terminal states. When a subscription enters one of these states, the user must repurchase the subscription to activate it again. The user is not entitled to use the services in these states.
             *  - When a subscription is Canceled, the expirationTime will be updated with the date and time of the cancellation.
             *  - The ID of the subscription will remain the same during its entire lifetime. It will not change if the auto-renew option is turned on or off. If a user repurchases a subscription after reaching a terminal state, a new subscription ID will be created.
             *  - The ID of a subscription should be used to execute any operation on an individual subscription.
             *  - When a user repurchases a subscription after cancelling or discontinuing it, if you query the results for the user you will get two entries: one with the old subscription ID in a terminal state, and one with the new subscription ID in an active state.
             *  - It's always a good practice to check both recurrenceState and expirationTime, since updates to recurrenceState can potentially be delayed by a few minutes (or occasionally hours).
