# iOS In-App Purchase plugin

 * Allows In-App Purchases to be made from a Phonegap Application.
 * Wraps StoreKit.

Original code: Matt Kane

Maintainer: Jean-Christophe Hoelt

## Install the Plugin

### PhoneGap/Cordova >= 3.0

For PhoneGap >= 3.0 this plugin can be installed with a single command:

    cordova plugin add git://github.com/j3k0/PhoneGap-InAppPurchase-iOS.git

Then some extra steps need to be done to disable ARC for the plugin's .m files. Follow [those instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6658549/271585) for InAppPurchase.m and SKProduct+LocalizedPrice.m

### PhoneGap <= 2.9 using Plugman

    plugman install --platform ios --project <path to Xcode project> --plugin git://github.com/j3k0/PhoneGap-InAppPurchase-iOS.git

See [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).

**NOTE: If you plan on using the cordova-cli to build your project, copy the cordova_plugins.js file in the root of the www directory to merges/<platform> directory at the root of the solution folder otherwise the cordova_plugins.js will be overwritten. 

    cp ./cordova_plugins.js ../../../merges/ios/cordova_plugins.js

See [Cordova Cli](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli).

### Manually

 * Copy the .h and .m file from `src/ios/` to the Plugins directory in your Xcode project. 
 * Create a `plugins` folder in your project's `<path to Xcode project>/www` folder if it does not exist.
 * Create a `com.phonegap.plugins.inapppurchase` folder inside the `plugins` folder.
 * Copy InAppPurchase.js into `<path to Xcode project>/www/plugins/com.phonegap.plugins.inapppurchase`
 * Add the following to the config.xml file in your Xcode project:

```xml
    <feature name="InAppPurchase">
       <param name="ios-package" value="InAppPurchase" />
    </feature>
```

 * Add the following to the config.xml file in your Xcode project:
 * Create a new file named `cordova_plugins.js` in the `<path to Xcode project>/www` folder if it does not exist.
 * Edit `cordova_plugins.js` and add a reference to the plugin to automatically load it:

```javascript
    cordova.define('cordova/plugin_list', function(require, exports, module) {
    module.exports = [
        {
            "file": "plugins/com.phonegap.plugins.inapppurchase/InAppPurchase.js",
            "id": "com.phonegap.plugins.inapppurchase.InAppPurchase",
            "clobbers": [
                "storekit"
	    ]
    	}
    ]
    });
```

## Using the plugin

**NOTE: In-app purchases can be complicated, with very unhelpful error messages and lots of things that need to be configured perfectly for them to work. I cannot provide support for them. Errors are highly unlikely to have been caused by the plugin. Please see the Apple Developer Forums for help!**

Please read [the In-App Purchase Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html) and the [iTunes Connect Developer Guide](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/docs/iTunesConnect_DeveloperGuide.pdf).

### Tutorial

### Documentation

The plugin adds the `window.storekit` object, with the following methods:

    storekit.init({
        purchase: function (transactionId, productId, transactionReceipt) {},
        restore:  function (originalTransactionId, productId, originalTransactionReceipt) {},
        error:    function (errorCode, errorText) {},
        ready:    function () {}
    })
    storekit.load(productIds, callback)
    storekit.purchase(productId, quantity)

You should also listen to the following events:

...

You should register the callbacks early in your app's initialisation process, because StoreKit will automatically attempt to complete any unfinished transactions when you launch the app.
If the plugin does receive callbacks before you have registered a handler, they will be placed into a queue and executed when you do register one.

Before attempting to make a purchase you should first call `load` to retrieve the localised product data. If you don't do this, then any attempt to make a purchase will fail.

A basic usage example is below:

    storekit.on('purchased', function (transactionId, productId, transactionReceipt) {
        console.log('purchased: ' + productId);
        /* Give coins, enable subscriptions etc */
    });
    
    storekit.on('restored', function (transactionId, productId, transactionReceipt) {
        console.log('restored: ' + productId);
        /* See the developer guide for details of what to do with this */
    });
    
    storekit.on('failed', function (errno, errtext) {
        console.log('failed: ' + errtext);
    });

    storekit.requestProductData("com.example.test", function (productId, title, description, price) {
        console.log("productId: " + productId);
        console.log("title: " + title);
        console.log("description: " + description);
        console.log("price: " + price);
        storekit.makePurchase(productId, 1);
    }, function (id) {
        console.log("Invalid product id: " + id);
    });
