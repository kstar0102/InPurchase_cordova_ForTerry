Need professional help and support? [Contact Me](mailto:hoelt@fovea.cc).

I dedicate a considerable amount of my free time to developing and maintaining
this Cordova plugin, along with my other Open Source software. To help ensure
this plugin is kept updated, new features are added and bugfixes are
implemented quickly, please donate a couple of dollars (or a little more if you
can stretch) as this will help me to afford to dedicate time to its
maintenance. Please consider donating if you're using this plugin in an app
that makes you money, if you're being paid to make the app, if you're asking
for new features or priority bug fixes. Thank you!

## Summary

This plugin allows **In-App Purchases** to be made from **Cordova, Ionic and Capacitor** applications.

It lets you handle in-app purchases on many platforms with a single codebase.

This is a plugin for the **Apache Cordova** framework that provides an easy and flexible way to integrate **in-app purchases** into Cordova-based mobile applications, including popular frameworks such as **Ionic and PhoneGap**.. With this plugin, you can easily add support for in-app purchases of digital content, such as subscriptions, consumables, and non-consumables, using the store-specific purchase APIs provided by the major mobile platforms. The plugin also supports requesting payments through popular payment providers such as **Braintree**, allowing you to easily accept payments from your users.

The Cordova-Plugin-Purchase plugin is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your Cordova app, and it provides a consistent API across all supported platforms, so you can focus on building your app without worrying about platform-specific differences. Whether you are building a subscription-based app, a freemium app, or any other app that requires in-app purchases, the Cordova-Plugin-Purchase plugin can help you get started quickly and easily.

## Installation

### Install the plugin (Cordova)

```sh
cordova plugin add "cordova-plugin-purchase"
```


### Recommended plugins

Sometimes, the plugin cannot connect to the app store because it has no network connection. It will then retry either:

* periodically after a certain amount of time;
* when the device fires an ['online'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/online) event.

The [cordova-plugin-network-information](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-network-information) plugin is required in order for the `'online'` event to be properly received in the Cordova application. Without it, this plugin will only be able to use the periodic check to determine if the device is back online.

Install <strong>cordova-plugin-advanced-http</strong> (click for details).

When making receipt validation requests, the purchase plugin uses, by default, the browser's ajax capabilities. This sometime causes issues with CORS restriction. CORS also imposes an extra back-and-forth with the server (the CORS preflight request) to ensure the server allows for such request to be made. By installing the [advanced-http plugin](https://github.com/silkimen/cordova-plugin-advanced-http), you get rid of those issue and benefit from the extra feature of the the plugin, like advanced authentication option. Read the [advanced-http](https://github.com/silkimen/cordova-plugin-advanced-http) plugin documentation for details.

### Note for Capacitor users

Capacitor users can install this new version of the plugin without the help of the awesome-cordova-plugins wrapper. Just install the `cordova-plugin-purchase` module and `import "cordova-plugin-purchase"` in files where it's needed. See [here](https://github.com/danielsogl/awesome-cordova-plugins/issues/4457) for some info.

### Setup your Application

See [Setup iOS Applications](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/wiki/Setup-for-iOS-and-macOS#setup-ios-applications) and [Setup Android Applications](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/wiki/Setup-for-Android-Google-Play#setup-android-applications).

## Getting Started

### Learning about In-App Purchases

If you wish to learn more about In-App Purchases (IAP), you'll find a good overview on the subject from the various platforms documentation:

* Apple:
   * [In-App Purchase Introduction](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase/)
   * [Auto-Renewable Subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/subscriptions)
* Google:
   * [In-App Purchases Best Practices](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/earn/in-app-purchases)
   * [Billing Overview](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_overview)
* Microsoft
  * [Monetize with In-App Purchases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/monetize/in-app-purchases-and-trials)

All platforms share the same concepts, so they are a good reads in all cases.

### Using the Plugin

To ease the beginning of your journey into the intimidating world of In-App Purchase with Cordova, we wrote a guide which hopefully will help you get things done:

* [Guide: Cordova In-App Purchase Plugin - v13.0](https://purchase.cordova.fovea.cc/v/v13.0/)

You'll have two main tasks to accomplish:

 1. Setup your application and In-App Products on AppStore, Play, Braintree or Azure platforms using their respective web interfaces.
 2. Add In-App Purchase code to your application.

For platform setup, the [wiki](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/wiki/Home) is a good starting point.

There's a specific page for the [version 13](./wiki/Version-13).

### Upgrading to Version 13

There's been some changes to the API with version 13 of the plugin. This document should help existing apps with the migration: [Migrate to version 13](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/wiki/HOWTO:-Migrate-to-v13).

## Extra Resources

### For iOS

 - [In-App Purchase Configuration Guide for AppStore Connect](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/)
   - Learn how to set up and manage In-App Purchases with AppStore Connect.

### Extensions

 - [Braintree SDK](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase-braintree)
   - Add the Braintree SDK to your application, enable Braintree on iOS and Android.

### Subscriptions

For proper subscription support, you need a receipt validation server. You can
implement your own or use [Iaptic's receipt validation service](https://www.iaptic.com).
