# Troubleshooting

#### iOS - Apple reject app because no IPv6 compatibility
Please check your `store.validator` settings! Your hostname need to be reachable via IPv4 and IPv6. If your hostname can't be connected via dualstack Apple will reject your app. This is mostly when you use product type `store.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION`.

#### Andorid - Problems with the payment (BILLING_KEY changed)
Sometimes you have to change the `BILLING_KEY`, if this is the case you have to handle several places to change the `BILLING_KEY`.
It is best to search for the old `BILLING_KEY` and change the `BILLING_KEY` with the new `BILLING_KEY`. This should fix all problems.
